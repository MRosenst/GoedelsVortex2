I know I live in a computer simulation because of irrational numbers.

Proof by induction shows how illogical mathematics is!

Infinity means that anything can be true for any reason.

Independent events means that flipping a coin 100 times gives a 50% probability of getting at least one heads.

Every statistic is actually 50% because everything either happens or it doesn't.

I believe in empirical mathematics. That's why the Collatz Conjecture is so hard to solve.

It's impossible to show that 2n+1 is of the form 2n+1.

Numbers are qualitative not quantitative.

My theory does not need to rely on a proof because it is its own proof. It is its own purest proof.

I say P \\approx NP because mankind isn't ready for P=NP. This is a safe medium.

This equation is algebraically undeniably and irrefutably true. But since it hasn't been sanctioned as yet by your "mentors" you would probably deem it false.

Are you the Pope of Math? What is this "math" you speak of? I speak of Truth and math is that subset of Truth that concerns numbers and topology. I delight in it. What is math to you? Your feeble scribbles?

Who is to say that an infinitely long number does not become itself sentient and is able to deny its own predefined definitions. That is infinity!
